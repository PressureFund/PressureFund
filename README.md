## About AquaTech

AquaTech is a forward-thinking software development company founded by a team of passionate developers. Our mission is to create impactful software solutions, focusing on AI-based technologies and contributing to the Linux kernel. We believe in open collaboration and are eager to work with other developers and organizations to drive innovation in these fields.

## Current Projects

### PacketWorx

PacketWorx is a Python-based AI assistant for Wireshark, designed to read, organize, and analyze network packet captures (PCAP files). It leverages `pyshark` for packet capture processing, `pandas` for data organization, and advanced machine learning techniques for packet classification and anomaly detection.

#### Features

- Reads and parses PCAP files and live captures using `pyshark`.
- Organizes packet information in a structured format using `pandas`.
- Implements advanced AI technology to classify packets based on their characteristics.
- Utilizes Gradient Boosting Classifier for packet classification.
- Detects anomalies in network traffic using Isolation Forest.
- Suggests filters for Wireshark based on packet analysis.
- Highlights suspicious and anomalous packets in the capture.

#### Installation

To install the required dependencies, run:

```bash
pip install pyshark pandas scikit-learn joblib
```

#### Usage

1. Ensure you have a PCAP file (e.g., example.pcap) that you want to analyze or specify a network interface for live capture.
2. Create a Python script (e.g., packetworx.py) with the provided content.

3. Replace `'example.pcap'` with the path to your actual PCAP file or specify a network interface for live capture.
4. Run the script with appropriate options:

```bash
# Analyze a pcap file
python packetworx.py --pcap example.pcap

# Analyze live capture from a network interface
python packetworx.py --interface eth0

# Suggest a filter for Wireshark
python packetworx.py --filter

# Highlight suspicious packets
python packetworx.py --highlight

# Highlight anomalous packets
python packetworx.py --anomalies
```

#### How It Works

- **Reading PCAP Files or Live Captures**: The `read_pcap` function uses `pyshark` to read and parse the PCAP file or live capture, extracting relevant packet information.
- **Organizing Data**: The extracted packet information is stored in a pandas DataFrame for easy manipulation and analysis.
- **Training the Model**: If a model does not already exist, the script trains a Gradient Boosting Classifier on the packet data using enhanced features and dummy labels.
- **Classifying Packets**: The trained model is used to classify packets, and the results are added to the DataFrame.
- **Anomaly Detection**: The script detects anomalies in the network traffic using Isolation Forest and adds the results to the DataFrame.
- **Suggesting Filters**: The `suggest_filter` method provides filter suggestions based on the packet analysis.
- **Highlighting Suspicious and Anomalous Packets**: The `highlight_suspicious_packets` and `highlight_anomalous_packets` methods print packets classified as suspicious or anomalous.

## Future Projects

### AquaCoinAI

AquaCoinAI aims to revolutionize ERC20 governance securities by creating a dual governance system combining community-based and AI-based governance. This innovative system is designed to enhance the security and reliability of the ERC20 blockchain ecosystem and support future cryptocurrency projects.

#### Dual Governance System

- **Community-Based Governance (50%)**: 
  - Shareholders are given the ultimate authority to vote on implementations and decisions within the ecosystem. 
  - Each shareholder gets one vote per proposal to ensure fairness and equal representation.
  - Proposals for new features, improvements, and changes can be submitted by any community member and will be voted on by the shareholders.

- **AI-Based Governance (50%)**: 
  - An advanced AI system acts as a guardian and innovator for the ecosystem, continuously analyzing trends, potential threats, and opportunities for improvement.
  - The AI system generates ideas and recommendations for enhancing the ecosystem's functionality, security, and innovation.
  - While the AI can suggest and develop detailed proposals, it does not have the authority to implement changes. All AI-generated ideas must be reviewed and approved by the community through the voting process.

#### Implementation of Voting

- **Proposal Submission**: Community members can submit proposals for changes or new features to the ecosystem.
- **Review Period**: Proposals are reviewed and discussed within the community for a set period, allowing for feedback and modifications.
- **Voting Process**: 
  - Each shareholder is entitled to one vote per proposal to maintain an equitable and honest governance system.
  - Votes are cast during a designated voting period, ensuring transparency and community engagement.
  - A proposal is approved if it receives a majority of votes from participating shareholders.

- **AI Proposals**: The AI governance system continuously monitors the ecosystem and external factors to generate innovative proposals. These proposals are submitted to the community for review and voting, similar to community-submitted proposals.

#### Roadmap

1. **Initial Development**: 
   - Develop the foundational AI system and integrate it with the ERC20 governance framework.
   - Implement the community-based voting mechanism and establish guidelines for proposal submission and review.

2. **Testing and Iteration**: 
   - Conduct thorough testing of the AI system and voting process to ensure reliability and security.
   - Gather feedback from early adopters and make necessary adjustments to the governance framework.

3. **Launch**: 
   - Officially launch the AquaCoinAI governance system, inviting community participation and collaboration.
   - Promote the system to existing and new ERC20 projects, highlighting the benefits of dual governance.

4. **Continuous Improvement**: 
   - Continuously enhance the AI system to improve its proposal generation capabilities.
   - Foster a vibrant community of contributors and voters to ensure the ecosystem remains dynamic and innovative.
